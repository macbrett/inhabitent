# RED Starter

A WordPress starter theme for RED Academy students, forked from Underscores.

Synopsis

Inhabitent is a Wordpress project that makes use of a significant amount of php and css. It is a fully-scoped website for a potential outdoor store. We used several different plugins as well as designing our own plugins.

Code Example

the following code was used in several places:

<div class="archive-title">
<h1><?php echo str_replace('Product Type: ','',get_the_archive_title()); ?></h1>
<p><?php echo term_description() ?></p>
</div>


Motivation

This project allowed me to explore wordpress and all its wonderful functionality. Underscores was used as a template for this project and we learned how to build a site from that foundation.

Installation

the project can be seen at the github account :macbrett



Tests

ThemeCheck, DebugBar and QueryCheck were all utilized.
